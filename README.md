## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [I have built a guessing game before using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I used that as a reference.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [While creating this submission, I struggled creating the randomization. I was, however, able to implement because I have made a guessing game in the past which required a similar randomization. Another challenge I faced was understanding the JavaScript code that was given in the walkthroughs.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I want to learn how API's are implemented into code files in web development.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I would do the rest of the optional features such as adding 3 strikes, speeding up the clue playback, and adding more buttons.]
